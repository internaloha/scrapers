If an individual is interested in interning with NSTEM but is not tied to formal education, the internship will be classified as a \"Volunteer Internship.\" This option is offered for individuals who are not interested in receiving academic credit but rather the experience at NSTEM.\nAccredited Internship: NSTEM works with colleges and universities to provide an experience that is directly related to desired learning outcomes and will complete all necessary paperwork.

Staff members provide opportunities for interns to work on projects that align with their learning goals with evaluation and constructive feedback along the way. NSTEM believes that successful internships go hand in hand with enjoyable internships. Staff will personally check-in with you throughout your internship experience and make adjustments as necessary in order to ensure that you achieve your internship goals.  Our team is constantly available for interns that work in the office as well as those that work virtually. Staff works with the requirements of colleges and universities in order to provide written feedback according to their specific policies.

Through sponsorships from companies, non-profits and individuals who want to sponsor chapters in their communities and through follow up of interested schools from our marketing efforts. To do this, NSTEM employs a robust state of the art engagement software called Outreach (https://www.outreach.io/) with a training program offered by Outreach University which allows interns to achieve expertise and badges of accomplishment rapidly. As this software is used so widely in the business world, getting this recognition and experience is a valuable experience for future employment and careers. Additionally, NSTEM has an effective and growing LinkedIn (about.linkedin.com/) approach to relationship building with superintendents, principals and STEM enthusiasts across the country and the world.

    "description": "RespectAbility is on the front lines of inclusive philanthropy. We are passionate about bringing intersectionality into not only our work, but into the philanthropy sector at-large. Many philanthropists do not explicitly include the disability community in their portfolio, even though disability cuts across every demographic – race/ethnicity, sex/gender, sexuality, religion, class and more. Indeed, the disability community is the largest minority group in the country. If a philanthropist supports any underserved population, they already are supporting people with disabilities. However, they may not do so with an understanding of what works, or they might not realize that some of their constituents have disabilities in the first place.\n\nThat is where our nonprofit management team comes in: we cultivate relationships with philanthropists who have mutual interests and are passionate about helping others. We provide them with best practices on how to include people with disabilities successfully in both their philanthropy and internal operations. We do this in a variety of ways, and the primary areas for Nonprofit Management Fellows are two-fold:\n\nSupport our work in reaching out to philanthropists – foundations, individuals and corporations – on how they can better serve people with disabilities, especially in their already existing work.\nBring in needed support so all of our departments – public policy, communications and faith-based inclusion – can function and expand so we can continue to fight stigmas and expand opportunities for people with disabilities. We ask philanthropists to support specific program areas, this fellowship program and general operations.\n\nOur program is fully accessible for people with disabilities and offers full-time in-house job coaching, skills development, and networking opportunities. Assistive technology and personal care support are available as needed.",

    "location": "Remote",
    "description": "Winter Political Campaign Internship\n\nHans Riemer for Montgomery County Executive is looking for remote and in-person interns for a competitive 2022 primary election. Applicants from college, high school, and more are encouraged to apply! This “Winternship” will run from December 15th through January 31st. (While applicants are strongly encouraged to apply before December 15th, we will accept applications through December 29th.)\n\nInterns will have the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of a modern progressive campaign. Prospective applicants will be placed in one of six departments: Social Media & Communications, Graphics, Organizing, Research & Policy, Finance & Political, or Direct Voter Contact. Previous experience is not required for most departments and interns will be taught the fundamentals of their department. Because this is a more intensive program, you’ll be fully integrated with our core senior leadership team.\n\nIf you are looking to expand your resume during the winter break, this is a great way to learn how an actual campaign runs, gain the basic skills needed to be an effective political organizer and strategist, and build your professional network.\n\nIn case you are wondering what a County Executive is:  it is a pretty big deal. The County Executive serves a similar role to a Mayor in a city, or a Governor in a state.  Located just outside of DC, Montgomery County has over 1 million residents [more than a congressional district] and is an influential local government nation-wide. Montgomery County is also home to a number of federal institutions (NIH, FDA, NIST, NOAA).
