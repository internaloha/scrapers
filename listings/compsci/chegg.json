This is an exciting opportunity for fellows to be involved with such critical activities to help protect our Nation. Fellows will conduct research on projects related to medical countermeasure (MCMs) development, including preclinical model development, non-clinical testing and evaluation, and clinical trials. Opportunities exist to present the results of these projects at national conferences and have the findings published in peer-reviewed journals. Other opportunities may include providing support to inter-agency working groups, assisting in the development of relevant policy documents, interacting with academic and industry partners, and participating in team communications with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), drug developers, Contract Research Organizations (CROs), and National Institute of Health (NIH) all to ensure progress toward BARDA’s mission. \n\nBARDA is engaged in program management; there will be no bench or wet lab research associated with these opportunities. Virtual presentations or travel for presentations at conferences/meetings may be required pending pandemic related travel restrictions. BARDA anticipates maintaining a largely virtual environment.

Through sponsorships from companies, non-profits and individuals who want to sponsor chapters in their communities and through follow up of interested schools from our marketing efforts. To do this, NSTEM employs a robust state of the art engagement software called Outreach (https://www.outreach.io/) with a training program offered by Outreach University which allows interns to achieve expertise and badges of accomplishment rapidly. As this software is used so widely in the business world, getting this recognition and experience is a valuable experience for future employment and careers.
