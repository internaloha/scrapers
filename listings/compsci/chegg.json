However, we are currently looking to identify two IT Security here in late 2021 to begin their internship in early 2022 (likely February). Internship length is determined with each candidate based upon their availability and our potential for full-time openings. Internships will be no shorter than 8 weeks and no longer than 12 weeks.\n\nLOCATION: In our commitment to work-life balance, our entire workforce is fully remote, as are our internships. Interns may work from wherever they have a solid internet connection and the ability to successfully complete internship learning and professional experiences.\n\nHOURS: This is a 40-hour per week internship, with work hours falling within standard business hours, approximately M-F, 8/9am-5/6pm.\n\nABOUT THE INTERNS WE'RE SEEKING: We're looking for interns who may be: 1.

    "description": "INDUSTRY: Information Technology Security\n\nINTERNSHIP AREA AVAILABLE: IT Security Auditing/Pen-Testing\n\nCOMPANY: BAI Security                                                         \n\nCOMPANY HQ: Schaumburg, IL (National firm, remote workforce)  \n\nABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY: Headquartered in the Chicago area is a pure play IT security assessment and compliance auditing firm, ready to give outstanding candidates a tremendous opportunity to learn, grow, and potentially secure full-time employment with our award-winning company.\n\nEstablished in 2007 and led by our Founding President/CEO Michael Bruck (2021 appointee to the prestigious Forbes Technology Council), BAI Security’s rocket growth is heavily spurred by a global need for highly qualified security assessment professionals… enter our unparalleled team of in-house experts, who’ll be your mentors.\n\nTIMEFRAME: Our internships are available year-round, so candidates are welcome to submit materials on a rolling basis. However, we are currently looking to identify two IT Security here in late 2021 to begin their internship in early 2022 (likely February). Internship length is determined with each candidate based upon their availability and our potential for full-time openings. Internships will be no shorter than 8 weeks and no longer than 12 weeks.\n\nLOCATION: In our commitment to work-life balance, our entire workforce is fully remote, as are our internships. Interns may work from wherever they have a solid internet connection and the ability to successfully complete internship learning and professional experiences.\n\nHOURS: This is a 40-hour per week internship, with work hours falling within standard business hours, approximately M-F, 8/9am-5/6pm.\n\nABOUT THE INTERNS WE'RE SEEKING: We're looking for interns who may be: 1. Superstar college seniors (ideally graduated by December 2021, so they can commit to a full-time internship) or recent Bachelor’s Degree graduates with a major in Cybersecurity, Information Technology, Computer Science, or other related degrees, to gain hands-on experience with our fast-growing company in one of the most exciting and critical industries on earth – I.T. security; OR 2. Talented, driven folks with some college coursework or an Associate’s Degree in the aforementioned areas, as well as some real-world experience in I.T. Security and/or certifications.\n\nWe’re excited to interview internship candidates who are ready to jump in and be trained in our array of security assessment services, while also enjoying the chance to apply recent studies and test the professional waters at a nationally-recognized company known for its friendly team, positive culture, high client satisfaction, and cutting-edge industry leadership.\n\nPOTENTIAL FOR HIRE: Unlike many organizations, that bring in a slew of interns only to turn them out a few months later, at BAI, we only bring in the number of interns for whom we foresee the strong potential for a permanent opening. That way, our interns are learning from our team, but also working for a likely opportunity.\n\nWhile we cannot guarantee a job offer at the end of an internship, we can say that 100% of our 2021 interns were offered and accepted permanent roles with us in IT Security, IT Compliance, and Marketing! As we DO anticipate openings in spring 2022 for the IT Security Team, these interns will have the rare chance to be exclusively considered for any openings before a competitive national search is conducted. As such, this is an exceptional opportunity to come in, learn, show us what you can do, and get to the “front of the line” for role consideration!\n\nINTERN STATUS: This is an 8- to 12-week, temporary, unpaid internship with the potential, at the 8- to 12-week mark, of turning into a full-time, permanent position with an annual salary and top tier Blue Cross Blue Shield benefits eligibility at the 90-day employment mark (medical, dental, vision, life, and optional 401K).\n\nI.T.

Solar power is becoming more affordable, and regions endowed with renewable energy sources like solar are placed to leverage a decentralized, off-grid approach to energy access. Off-grid mobile clinics are increasingly playing an important role in maximizing reach remote communities while lowering cost barriers of healthcare access.\n\nSolar-Fi clinics are outfitted with basic medical equipment (sterilization systems, drug refrigeration, point of care diagnostics devices) delivered at low cost with a focus on sustainability. \n\nWe leverage public-private-partnerships to source medical equipment donated by private corporations. In any health strategy, community engagement is key. Solar-fi Cares collaborates with community-based health partners to enhance their patient engagement at the last mile. Many rural residents do not access preventive health care due to low awareness, and high indirect costs (of transportation, the opportunity cost of working). As a result, they often only seek healthcare services in an urgent situation and when it is most costly. Engaging with community health partners to provide education and outreach is critical for the high utilization of clinic services. Community engagement also makes health provision fiscally sound through adopting cost-sharing via community-based insurance schemes.\n\nOur model also recognizes the role of technology to streamline patient operations and digital tools to connect rural health workers with urban hospitals. Patient records are managed via digital patient management platforms, which can be used across rural-urban health systems in cases of referrals.\n\nWe were recently selected as a top 100 startup change-maker by Hubweek which is put on by Harvard. We are looking for talented people that can help us to reduce poverty in developing countries. In 2020 we won the emerging market innovation of the year award.\n\nSolarFi seeks a Sponsored Programs coordinator who can continue to grow our external funding portfolio.
