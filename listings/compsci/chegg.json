In order to fulfill our mission, we need to communicate with educators who are passionate about helping their students in STEM. To meet our weekly goals of outreach to these educators, all NSTEM interns are required to spend no more than 2-hours a week collecting this critical and game changing information. When you are researching these educators, you are literally selecting the people who will be changing the lives of their students by taking part in the National STEM Honor Society. This role is one of the most important parts of working here at NSTEM.  You will gain so many useful skills such as how to be a more effective researcher and how to remain organized all while playing a key role in expanding the size and scale of NSTEM. As Interns join NSTEM’s leadership, they take on increasing responsibilities and are not required to do weekly information collection.\n\n24 Hour Company: At NSTEM, we operate 24 hours a day and allow you to work based on your own schedule to complete projects and meet deadlines. However, interns need to be aware that they need to attend any synchronous meetings as requested by management. NSTEM meetings are typically held between 8 AM - 5:30 PM EST. While we know we have interns from across the globe who join our organization, we cannot guarantee to accommodate all NSTEM meetings based on all time zones.\n\nLeadership and Management: Are you a leader or would you like to be? The National STEM Honor Society Internship program is looking to identify and bring on leaders who will continue to drive toward our mission of helping as many students as possible as quickly as possible!

We have several roles including Senior Directors, Directors, Department Managers, Team Leaders, and Project Managers. All the roles have varying degrees of responsibilities ranging from managing a small team dedicated to a single project, to being a Department Manage managing several teams and projects, to becoming a Senior Director working and learning side by side our Administrative management team. This is an opportunity to quickly hone your leadership and management skills, two of the most future ready and important skills to learn and build upon as you continue your journey through life and career.\n\nSKILLS REQUIRED: These soft skills include that ability to mentor interns and to train them quickly toward a vision, quick and positive communications, reliability, team building, patience and empathy. The logistical skills include being organized, running meetings, assigning tasks, following up, identifying other leaders for promotion and using Google Docs and Trello to manage the goal directed activities of your team.   \n\nSales, Partnership and Sponsorship Strategies: Some of the most important keys to helping as many students and educators as we can as quickly as we can in STEM education enhancement, inspiration and recognition is to open school based chapters of NSTEM through partnerships with key organizations who believe what we believe. Through sponsorships from companies, non-profits and individuals who want to sponsor chapters in their communities and through follow up of interested schools from our marketing efforts. To do this, NSTEM employs a robust state of the art engagement software called Outreach (https://www.outreach.io/) with a training program offered by Outreach University which allows interns to achieve expertise and badges of accomplishment rapidly. As this software is used so widely in the business world, getting this recognition and experience is a valuable experience for future employment and careers. Additionally, NSTEM has an effective and growing LinkedIn (about.linkedin.com/) approach to relationship building with superintendents, principals and STEM enthusiasts across the country and the world.

ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: The project will focus on the chemical ecology of Oriental fruit fly (OFF), Bactrocera dorsalis, one of the most destructive invasive pests of tropical crops worldwide. Current OFF quarantine programs focus on the surveillance and control of male flies. However, the male-oriented strategy is less effective for mitigating the impact caused by female populations, which could lead to fruit damage and ensuing trade issues. The primary goal of the project is to develop novel female attractants that can target different physiological status of female flies. The participant will join a multidisciplinary team of researchers and collaborate on (1) behavioral testing of volatiles emitted from microbes, host plants and protein food, (2) identification of key attractant volatiles using GC-EAD and GC-MS, and (3) field testing of developed lures and baits.\n\nLearning Objectives: The participant will be encouraged to develop independent and collaborative research, publish research results, and promote technology transfer through conference attendance, presentations and Cooperative Research And Development Agreements with commercial companies.\n\nMentor(s): The mentors for this opportunity are Dong Cha (dong.cha@usda.gov) and Paul Kendra (paul.kendra@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: January 2022.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full-time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\nQuestions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email USDA-ARS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.",

Whether you are a new writer looking to launch your career and build your portfolio or you are an experienced writer looking to break into a new field and improve your skills (while helping animals in the process), there is a spot for you at Furzly! You will be working on our sister companies' website Preferable Pups.\n\nWho We Are: \n\nWe’re on a mission to help pets around the world! With our sights set on becoming the most authoritative pet platform available, Furzly leads the conversation about pet health and information while still producing media that reminds us how much of a treasure animals are. How? We do this by empowering our writing community to create valuable, insightful content that can be leveraged on a global scale. Our success is dependent on having a community of writers that create stories for our educational platform.\n\nThat’s where you come in!\n\nWho We Are Looking For: \n\nWe understand that internships these days can be difficult to land, and the unfortunate truth about building a writing career is that you need a starting point to prove your worth and build your skillset. Fortunately, we are here to help! Here are the types of people we are looking to add to our Furzly team:\n\nYou Have a Passion for Pets: Since we are a pet site, this is a must! Our furry friends are our passion and they should be yours as well!\nYou Are Upbeat and Positive: Negative attitudes make for poor workplace environments (even in remote positions!). We want everyone on our team to have a great attitude when they approach their work and speak with other members of the team. If your tail is not wagging, we are not having it!\nYou Are Motivated to Make Every Article Your Best: There are writers who approach writing like work and there are writers who approach writing with the intent to provide their readers with value. You want every piece to be your best, and you want to make sure that it is the most authoritative on the web. You get out what you put in!\nYou Are Organized and Can Work With Our Editorial Team: We all have late days and messy desks, but we want you to be an individual who is highly-organized and who loves keeping track of their tasks from start to finish.

Now that we have you here, let’s talk about some of the expectations that we will have for you in this internship position.\n\nYou Are Available to Write (Ideally) Two Blog Posts Per Day: We don’t ask for much, but we do want you to be available to write (ideally) two blog posts per day.

We don’t just accept that, we prefer it. Our internship is designed to be flexible to better meet the needs of each individual intern in the rapidly changing philanthropic world.
