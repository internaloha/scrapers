    "description": "Green Scholars - Sustainability & Environmental Curriculum Development Virtual/Remote Internship  \n\nThe Green Scholars program is a project-based, honors-level high school curriculum that seeks to inspire high school students to create change in their communities while building a foundation of knowledge that will enable them to do so. By educating students on the basics of sustainability, giving them resources to succeed in professional settings, and helping students develop skills necessary to complete a sustainability project for their community, the Green \n\nScholars program strives to empower students to help create a more sustainable world. The Green Scholars Development team consists of four sub-teams: environmental literacy, professional skills, project management, and program management. \n\nInterns on all sub-teams will work on content development, along with editing and revising the current curriculum. In addition, interns may work on video projects and online content design for the online version of the curriculum.\n\nSubteams:\n\nEnvironmental Literacy\n\nThe Environmental Literacy sub-team educates students on the basics of the environment and the importance of sustainability. By becoming more environmentally literate, students can better implement sustainability into their projects and everyday lives. This team focuses on teaching students the basics of environmental science theory and applications to real world issues.\n\nProfessional Skills\n\nMembers of the Professional Skills subteam help educate students on the basics of how to succeed in professional settings after high school. Many students are not trained for the next steps of their careers, whether they want to apply to college, seek out an internship, or start a professional career right out of the gate. The Professional Skills team seeks to bridge that gap and teach the skills needed to help students succeed.\n\nProject Management\n\nThis team educates students on the basics of how to successfully design and implement a project in their school or community. Project development is a vital part of the Green Scholars curriculum. It allows students to explore and understand sustainability through hands-on projects. Through these projects, students will develop management and communication skills that they will use for the rest of their lives. This team ensures students will have the resources necessary to bring positive change to their communities. Currently, interns on the Project Management team also work on the Program Management team.\n\nProgram Management\n\nThis sub-team assists teachers in implementing the Green Scholars program and prepares them for the wide array of scenarios they may face while implementing the curriculum. As each school and student is unique, this team gives teachers resources to modify the curriculum based on the needs of their community. For example, coastal schools may wish to focus on ocean issues, while schools in more rural areas may have students wishing to explore projects in agriculture.  Currently, interns in the Program Management team also work on the Project Management team.\n\nSkills needed for all sub-teams of Green Scholars: \n\nExcellent research, writing, and editing skills\nAbility to think critically about real world issues\nGood organization and communication\nCreativity and being open to new ideas\nWillingness to learn\nTeam Player\n\nDesired Experience:\n\nExperience teaching in an educational environment (any age level, but middle/high school preferred)\nResearch, whether done in school or otherwise\nBackground in writing\nPast sustainability work, especially in a community setting\nVideo production skills are a plus",
