    "description": "Full Job Description Summary\n\nWaybridge is a well-funded startup that is using technology and data science to create efficiencies in the multi-trillion dollar industry of trading and logistics of physical commodities. We are currently a team comprising of technology experts who have revolutionized the ad-tech industry, commodity experts with years of experience in various commodities, and award winning designers and product managers. We are based in New York, London, and remote.\n\nThis posting is for a software engineering intern to join our team in NYC during Summer 2022. You will be joined by past interns who are now full time employees.\n\nIn this role, you will be a full-fledged engineer as part of one of our tech teams:\n\nYou will work alongside other engineers, tackling different tickets allocated to you. You will be a part of daily standup meetings, and discussions with the product and design team\n\nYou will tackle problems from start to finish, writing tech specs, and implementing them in different parts of our application\n\nYou will be able to learn from other team members, particularly from your dedicated mentor, who will be a more senior member of the team\n\nAs a software engineer in a small team, you will be able to learn from some amazing engineers and start contributing almost straight away to our product. You will get to experience first hand at what it takes to make a successful startup and product.\n\nApplicant Profile\n\nYou need to have some experience in computer programming. A computer science degree is not required, however you need to demonstrate an ability and interest in writing code and solving problems.\n\nOur tech stack is:\nPython and GraphQL\n\nReact, Relay, and Typescript\n\nAWS, Kubernetes, Docker\n\nAutomated CI/CD with dev, staging, and production environments\n\nSo any experience in any of these will be useful, but do not be put off from applying if your experience does not match our stack.\n\nIf your internship goes well we will aim to offer you a job to start the subsequent year, as such undergraduate applicants will need to be in their penultimate year, graduating in 2023. You are welcome to apply if you are not in university, provided that you can expect to be able to start a job in summer/autumn 2023, and that you have the level of experience we would expect for an intern (i.e you are not just about to go to university, and you are not already a professional software engineer).\n\nProject Summary\n\nThink about how easy it is for you to purchase something online; you can see various options, filter by different features, and then once ordered, track where your delivery is until it arrives at your doorstep.\n\nIt might surprise you that such systems do not yet exist for manufacturers or suppliers who are looking to buy or sell raw material, such as aluminium, copper or cocoa. Such purchases are currently extremely manual, using a combination of emails, phone calls, text messages to track purchases, sales and deliveries.\n\nWe are tackling these problems by:\nBringing market intelligence and pricing tools to small and large manufacturers and producers of physical commodities\n\nProviding financing, price discovery and other facilities to create a more transparent marketplace and enabling companies to trade with new counterparties\n\nImproving ability to manage complex commodities trades and improve logistics and tracking of commodities around the world. This mean optimized delivery routes, with benefits such as a reduction in carbon footprint\n\nMore specifically, as an engineer here are some of the problems you might tackle:\n\nUpgrading and expanding commodity trade functionality\n\nBuilding a dashboard to gain insights into shipment tracking data\n\nImplement new logging in Datadog to improve error handling\n\nImproving the performance of particular component of the code by re-writing it, or using newer libraries\n\nInteracting with client/data provider APIs to improve the visibility of commodity trades in our platform\n\nInterview process\n\nRight now our interview process is completely remote. An outline of the process is given below, and we will try to give you as much detail as we can on what to expect in each of these steps before you actually get to them.\n\nIf we like the look of your application, we will send you a take home coding challenge to do in your own time\n\nYou will then have an interview with one of our team, part of which may involve discussing your solution to the take home problem\n\nThere will then be a final round interview, which will largely devoted to discussing a different technical problem and how you would go about solving it\n\nDiversity\n\nWe are proud to have a diverse team, with many of our current team comprising of people from underrepresented groups in the technology industry. We are an equal opportunity employer and we value and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for our employees. However, we know we can always do better and are always happy to hear thoughts and recommendations.\n\nDisability\n\nWe are happy to accommodate people who may need extra provisions to be able to work comfortably.

    "description": "Full Job Description Applied Sciences and Technology - Climate Modeling Internships\n\nAre you interested in honing your climate modeling, data science and software development skills while learning about cutting-edge developments in Artificial Intelligence? Do you have a passion for applying technology to do good in the world? If so, an internship in the Applied Science and Technology (AST) Climate Modeling team at AI2 may be the perfect opportunity. We will be reviewing applications and scheduling interviews for Summer 2022 internships in December/January. Start dates will be determined based on your availability and will be 12 weeks in duration.\n\nThe AST Climate Modeling team has diverse internship opportunities in its Machine Learning (ML) and Domain-Specific Language (DSL) groups. The ML group designs machine learning software that makes climate models predict rainfall and temperature patterns and extremes more accurately across a range of climates. The DSL group makes prototype climate models of the future, which represent the earth using very fine computational grids, run faster and with higher energy efficiency on large high-performance computing systems that use accelerators such as graphical processing units (GPUs). You will work closely with a technical mentor on project design, coding and testing. Over the course of your time at AI2, you will build your resume and leave an impact on AI2 and the world.\n\nWe have a beautiful office in Fremont near a bike trail and Lake Union; daily catered lunches; great pay; and smart, friendly and helpful co-workers.\n\nWhat we're looking for: (please specify which group(s) you would wish to work with)\n\nGraduate students in science, applied math/statistics or engineering (ML only) or computational or computer science (ML and DSL) with strong skills in Python and collaborative software development in git and great communication skills\nEager to learn new skills and like to work in a challenging environment\n(ML) Prior training & practical experience in machine learning and graduate-level course work in atmospheric or climate science are a plus\n(DSL) Prior training & practical experience with high-performance computing, compiler design, or numerical methods are a plus\n\nPlease specify in which Intern opportunity(s) you are interested*\nInternship opportunities in ML group\n\nWe train ML on reference simulations made with an ultra-realistic fine-grid global weather forecast model. The ML aims to better predict future climate change by improving coarser-grid climate models run for decades to centuries. Intern projects include:\n\nML detection of out-of-sample forecast drift: ML-assisted climate model forecasts may 'drift' away from the range of data used for ML training, leading to unreliable ML and poor simulation skill. The intern will help design and implement ML software to flag when an atmospheric column lies too far outside the training range.\n\nML of cloud condensate PDFs: The reference fine-grid model makes realistic predictions of cloud properties within each grid cell spanned by the target coarse-grid model. The intern will help design and implement ML software to predict the statistical distribution of liquid and ice clouds within each coarse model grid column and relate this to surface radiation and precipitation.\n\nInternship opportunities in DSL group\n\nIn collaboration with international partners, we are developing a Python-based domain-specific language (DSL) and compiler for running weather and climate models on the world's largest supercomputers, using an open-source, Python-based DSL toolchain. Interns will:\n\nContribute to implementation, performance analysis and optimization of the DSL compiler.\nContribute to implementation, validation, and optimization of the climate model.\n\nJoint ML/DSL internship opportunity\n\nThis internship will use ML to improve the accuracy of the numerical representation of wind predictions by the climate model.\n\nWho We Are:\nThe Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence is a non-profit research institute in Seattle founded by Paul Allen and headed by Professor Oren Etzioni. The core mission of AI2 is to contribute to humanity through high-impact research in artificial intelligence.\n\nWhy AI2:\nIn addition to AI2's core mission, we also aim to contribute to humanity through how we treat each member of the AI2 Team! Some highlights are:\n\nWe are a learning organization – because everything AI2 does is ground-breaking, we are learning every day. Similarly, through weekly AI2 Academy lectures, a wide variety of world-class AI experts as guest speakers, and our commitment to your personal on-going education, AI2 is a place where you will have opportunities to continue learning right alongside us;\nWe value diversity - We seek to hire, support, and promote people from all genders, ethnicities, and all levels of experience regardless of age. We particularly encourage applications from women, non-binary individuals, people of color, members of the LGBTQA+ community, and people with disabilities of any kind.\nWe value inclusion - We understand the value that people's individual experiences and perspectives can bring to an organization, and we are building a culture in which all voices are heard, respected and considered.\nWe emphasize a healthy work/life balance – we believe our team members are happiest and most productive when their work/life balance is optimized. While we value powerful research results which drive our mission forward, we also value dinner with family, weekend time, and vacation time. We offer generous paid vacation and sick leave as well as family leave;\nWe are collaborative and transparent – we consider ourselves a team, all moving with a common purpose. We are quick to cheer our successes, and even quicker to share and jointly problem solve our failures;\nWe are in Seattle – and our office is on the water! We have mountains, we have lakes, we have four seasons, we bike to work, we have a vibrant theater scene, and we have so much else. We even have kayaks for you to paddle right outside our front door;\nWe welcome interest from applicants from outside of the United States;\nWe are friendly – chances are you will like every one of the 100+ (and growing!) people who work here. We do!\n\nAI2 is proud to be an Equal Opportunity employer.

    "description": "Full Job Description Organizational Overview:\nSince 1993, Women for Women International, a global NGO, has invested in the power of over 500,000 women who are forgotten – the women survivors of war and conflict. We support them in learning the social and economic skills they need to rebuild their lives, their families, and their communities.\n\nOur core belief is that stronger women build stronger nations. Women who enroll in our programs in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Kosovo, Nigeria, Rwanda, and South Sudan, break the isolation of war and conflict. They gain access to knowledge, resources and tools needed to earn and save money, improve health and well-being, influence decisions in their home and community, and connect to networks for support.\n\nOver the next ten years, our goal is to scale our impact to improve the lives of millions of the most marginalized women affected by war and conflict. Our vision is to create a world in which all women determine the course of their lives and reach their full potential. We know that women pass on their knowledge to their neighbors and children, creating a ripple effect for generations. By investing in women, we create a better world for all of us – a world that’s more equal, peaceful, and prosperous.\n\nThat is the power of women, for women.\n\nPlease visit us at womenforwomen.org to learn more about the impact of our work.\n\nProject Description:\nThe Technology Intern will assist in the design and implementation of many unique and challenging projects.
