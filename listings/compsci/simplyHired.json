At CMC, it’s the people inside our recycling centers, fabrication plants, steel mills and offices that make us who we are as a company. Our success comes from finding, retaining, and supporting the highest quality talent by offering:\n\nCompetitive compensation\nAdvancement opportunities\nTraining\nPaid time off\nLow-cost medical, dental, vision\nCompany-paid life and disability\nCompany matching 401(k) plan\nEmployee stock purchase plan\nWhy This Job\n\nTo be a leader you’ve got to stay ahead of the curve. That’s why CMC has always been — and will continue to be — an early adopter of smart, new manufacturing techniques and technology. Our automated Steel Micro Mill in Durant, OK melted and rolled our first heat in December of 2017. We connect the two main steps in rebar production - melting recyced scrap into molten steel and forming that steel into a finished product in a single uninterrupted strand. We also use energy more efficiently than the mini mill and our technology allows us to cast steel faster and to run continuously.\n\nInternship Details\n\nCMC Steel Oklahoma is seeking students currently enrolled in an accredited Bachelor's Automation-related degree program (Automation Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechatronic Engineering, Computer Science) for our 2022 Summer Internship Program. This internship gives you exposure to our full process from scrap metal to finished rebar.

At CMC, it’s the people inside our recycling centers, fabrication plants, steel mills and offices that make us who we are as a company. Our success comes from finding, retaining, and supporting the highest quality talent by offering:\n\nCompetitive compensation\nAdvancement opportunities\nTraining\nPaid time off\nLow-cost medical, dental, vision\nCompany-paid life and disability\nCompany matching 401(k) plan\nEmployee stock purchase plan\nWhy This Job\n\nTo be a leader you’ve got to stay ahead of the curve. That’s why CMC has always been — and will continue to be — an early adopter of smart, new manufacturing techniques and technology. Our automated Steel Micro Mill in Durant, OK melted and rolled our first heat in December of 2017. We connect the two main steps in rebar production - melting recyced scrap into molten steel and forming that steel into a finished product in a single uninterrupted strand. We also use energy more efficiently than the mini mill and our technology allows us to cast steel faster and to run continuously.\n\nInternship Details\n\nCMC Steel Oklahoma is seeking students currently enrolled in an accredited Bachelor's Automation-related degree program (Automation Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechatronic Engineering, Computer Science) for our 2022 Summer Internship Program. This internship gives you exposure to our full process from scrap metal to finished rebar.

At CMC, it’s the people inside our recycling centers, fabrication plants, steel mills and offices that make us who we are as a company. Our success comes from finding, retaining, and supporting the highest quality talent by offering:\n\nCompetitive compensation\nAdvancement opportunities\nTraining\nPaid time off\nLow-cost medical, dental, vision\nCompany-paid life and disability\nCompany matching 401(k) plan\nEmployee stock purchase plan\nWhy This Job\n\nTo be a leader you’ve got to stay ahead of the curve. That’s why CMC has always been — and will continue to be — an early adopter of smart, new manufacturing techniques and technology. Our automated Steel Micro Mill in Durant, OK melted and rolled our first heat in December of 2017. We connect the two main steps in rebar production - melting recyced scrap into molten steel and forming that steel into a finished product in a single uninterrupted strand. We also use energy more efficiently than the mini mill and our technology allows us to cast steel faster and to run continuously.\n\nInternship Details\n\nCMC Steel Oklahoma is seeking students currently enrolled in an accredited Bachelor's Automation-related degree program (Automation Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechatronic Engineering, Computer Science) for our 2022 Summer Internship Program. This internship gives you exposure to our full process from scrap metal to finished rebar.

    "description": "About the Team Productivity Engineering team members at TeleTracking are the engineer's engineers. We aim to simplify and amplify the ability for developers to build, deploy, release, and observe their changes in production. By creating software development experiences that provide abstractions around common scenarios, we pave the way for developers to focus on their core business domains. We practice an observability-first and product-minded approach to the services that we develop and operate. To do this, we work backwards from customer value and ease of use, to planning the metrics that will help us differentiate what is working from what isn't before writing a line of code. We validate the effectiveness of our offerings by applying them in production to internally and externally facing services that we own. About the Role As a software engineer, you will have autonomy to architect, build and operate components of the delivery and observability platforms that are critical to TeleTracking's needs. You will collaborate with a customer base to explore how they build and deploy changes to uncover the friction that slows them down from deploying to production. With an end-to-end understanding, you will build a developer experience that leverages your findings. An example of a developer experience that Productivity Engineering team members build is designing an interface, iterating over it until they are satisfied that it is easy to use and implementing its backend services. The backend services are instrumented with metrics that help the team gain insights on usage and improvements. You will grow, learn, and be challenged by working across many technology stacks that go across build and deployment systems, to cloud infrastructure and microservices, and to security and observability tooling. What will you learn? Building and operating resilient services that are observable with key metrics and visualize them in Grafana dashboards Leveraging AWS services such as Lambda, EKS, S3, EC2, RDS Designing and writing HTTP and RESTful APIs Designing reusable deployment pipelines in Spinnaker using kustomize and pipeline templates Applying large-scale changes across 100s of source code repositories Helping other engineers to build software better, faster and safely Researching, evaluating, implementing and operating extensions to delivery and observability platforms What we use today Java, Python, Go, JavaScript, react, bash, AWS, Azure, Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Spinnaker, git What we expect Working towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related technical field involving software engineering, or equivalent practical experience 0-2 years of experience with an object oriented or functional programming language Bonus Points Experience with observability Experience with full cycle development Building developer-facing tools Interest in developing services as well as the underlying infrastructure Experience programming in Java, Python, Go, C++ * WHO ARE WE?* For over 30 years, TeleTracking has been operating with a simple mission, to ensure that no one waits for the care they need. Our state-of-the-art technology, combined with actionable best practices and a strong advisory services team, means that we provide the critical operational components required to build a responsive, resilient healthcare system. One of those key components is the centralization of hospital operations…the ability to see in real-time everything from the number of available beds to receive and treat patients to the number of pieces of available medical equipment. TeleTracking values people with an entrepreneurial spirit, creativity and building strong relationships with our employees. We believe that diversity, equity and inclusion in our workforce keeps us competitive and provides opportunities for everyone.

With a wide range of gardening products from grow kits, to seeds, to live plants and raised beds - we want to help every family experience the magic and joy of gardening and growing their own food.\n\nOur products are part of thousands of classroom curriculums nationwide, and sold in 10,000+ stores including Walmart, The Home Depot, Lowe's, Target, Amazon, Whole Foods, HEB, and Costco.\n\nEach Back to the Roots team member contributes directly to the success of our mission.
