    "description": "Our Trust and Safety Team has broad responsibilities to ensure the trust and safety of Apple services through a combination of threat modeling, data-driven policy, and machine learning. We are seeking a software engineer who can help us develop and deploy highly scalable systems that are used by hundreds of millions of users every day across the globe. We collaborate with other engineers, feature teams, and business partners across a wide range of groups within Apple to identify problems, define solutions, execute plans, measure results and communicate these results to our partners. We have end-to-end responsibility for our solutions to these problems, from initial investigation, to solution proposal, to implementation, to long-term maintenance. We encourage our team to stay abreast of current research by attending conferences. We cultivate a collaborative work environment, but allow solution autonomy on projects.\n\nDay-to-day responsibilities of this role include:\n\nCollaborating with stakeholders across Apple to arrive at software design decisions that impact both internal and customer-facing features.\nScoping software application requirements for new projects.\nWorking alongside Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and Platform Engineers to improve our machine learning platforms and decisioning systems.",
