We are focused on building a stable product that brings tangible benefits to our users.\nWe believe in solving real problems for our users and providing tools that help healthcare companies grow and better serve their patients.\nYou'll have the latitude needed to dive deep into issues, make recommendations on process improvements, and talk with users of PocketDoc to help make informed decisions.\n\nThe nitty gritty:\n\nOur frontends are written using React & Typescript, deployed automatically using GitHub actions. Our mobile app is built on React Native (with Typescript) with automated CodePush deployments through GitHub actions.\nOur backend API is written in Go and hosted in AWS. Data is stored in MongoDB and we use Firebase for some real-time data.\nTwilio and Postmarkapp power our communication channels with Patients. We use WebRTC to power face-to-face video chats between Providers and Patients.\nWe integrate directly with EPIC EMR (Electronic Medical Records system) to look up patient information and handle the scheduling internals.\n\nJob Type: Full-time\n\nBenefits:\n\n401(k)\n401(k) matching\nDental insurance\nFlexible spending account\nHealth insurance\nHealth savings account\nPaid time off\n\nSchedule:\n\n8 hour shift\nMonday to Friday\n\nAbility to commute/relocate:\n\nSan Diego, CA 92103: Reliably commute or planning to relocate before starting work (Required)\n\nApplication Question(s):\n\nWhat was your school GPA?\nHow many years of software development experience do you have?\n\nWork Location: One location\n\nShow more",

We are focused on building a stable product that brings tangible benefits to our users.\nWe believe in solving real problems for our users and providing tools that help healthcare companies grow and better serve their patients.\nYou'll have the latitude needed to dive deep into issues, make recommendations on process improvements, and talk with users of PocketDoc to help make informed decisions.\n\nThe nitty gritty:\n\nOur frontends are written using React & Typescript, deployed automatically using GitHub actions. Our mobile app is built on React Native (with Typescript) with automated CodePush deployments through GitHub actions.\nOur backend API is written in Go and hosted in AWS. Data is stored in MongoDB and we use Firebase for some real-time data.\nTwilio and Postmarkapp power our communication channels with Patients. We use WebRTC to power face-to-face video chats between Providers and Patients.\nWe integrate directly with EPIC EMR (Electronic Medical Records system) to look up patient information and handle the scheduling internals.\n\nJob Type: Full-time\n\nBenefits:\n\n401(k)\n401(k) matching\nDental insurance\nFlexible spending account\nHealth insurance\nHealth savings account\nPaid time off\n\nSchedule:\n\n8 hour shift\nMonday to Friday\n\nAbility to commute/relocate:\n\nSan Diego, CA 92103: Reliably commute or planning to relocate before starting work (Required)\n\nApplication Question(s):\n\nWhat was your school GPA?\nHow many years of software development experience do you have?\n\nWork Location: One location\n\nShow more",
